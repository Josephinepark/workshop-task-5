# Workshop 5 : Data and Visualisation

[Website Link] https://josephinepark.github.io/workshop-task-5/

- A dropdown menu : allow users to select different types of beverages. Once a beverage is selected, the user can check the amount I have drunk over the past week.

## Task
[] Produce a 'data self-portrait' in a p5.js sketch by making a visualisation that shows something about yourself from a dataset. Use a csv file to store the dataset.<Br>
[] Experiemnt with different ways to present the data, e.g. using text, images, shapes, or colours.

for this workshop task, I made my own chart form excel and made it as a csv file. I have made a chart, how much beverages I have drunk over a week.

from the workshop, I have learnt how to make a table and load images based on my chart as a cvs file. 
At first, I considered displaying the entire chart in a table format to show all beverage information at once. However, I realized that presenting everything on one screen could make the screen too cluttered and overwhelming for the user. This led me to think about a more intuitive and user-friendly way to present the data.
During this process, I recalled using a dropdown menu in a previous workshop when working with emojis. I thought that incorporating a dropdown would be a great solution, allowing users to select a specific beverage and view its corresponding details easily.
Instead of just displaying numerical data, I decided that when a beverage was selected, an image representing the amount consumed would appear. This approach would make the information easier to understand and provide a more engaging visual experience for users.
